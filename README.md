### [CS-NCSM, 2021-2025](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/cs-ncsm)
- A numerical calculation of the energy levels of light nuclei within the complex-scaling and no-core shell model (CS-NCSM).
- Wrote: I extended the NCSM code with complex scaling.
         I Prepared an extensive software for handling the ouput of the calculation, and visualize the results.
- Notes: Requires external data source (some examples are available)

### [Monte Carlo Simulation, 2020](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/atmospheric-muon-simulation-KM3net)
- A monte carlo simulation of the muon flux at the detectors of the KM3NET experiment.
- Wrote: The full python simulation code.
### [Course assigments, 2020](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/course-assignments)
- Various course assigments that I did during my Erasmus mundus Master studies (2019-2020).
