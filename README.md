### [Ad interaction prediction (2025)](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/ad-interaction-prediction)  
A mini-project that focuses on **predicting user interactions with online advertisements** using machine learning models built in **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

The notebook explores how preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics affect the performance of predictive models for three user behaviors:  
- **label_view** â€“ whether the user views an ad  
- **label_click** â€“ whether the user clicks on an ad  
- **label_landing** â€“ whether the user lands on the advertiserâ€™s site or completes a purchase

Accurate prediction of these events is crucial for improving **ad placement**, **user experience**, and **advertising revenue optimization**. 
### [CS-NCSM (2021â€“2025)](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/cs-ncsm)  
A numerical study of the energy levels of light nuclei using the Complex Scaling and No-Core Shell Model (CS-NCSM), originally developed by a large team of physicists, notably Petr Navratil and collaborators, TRIUMF . My work was in a collaboration with **Guillaume Hupin** at **Paris-Saclay (IJC-Lab)**, contributing to the theoretical and computational framework of the project.  
**My contributions:**  
- Extended the existing **Fortran-based** NCSM code to incorporate **complex scaling techniques**.  
- Developed a **Python-based post-processing toolkit** to handle and visualize the outputs of large-scale computations.  
- Contributed to **high-performance computing (HPC)** efforts, including code optimization to efficiently run on distributed systems (OpenMP).  
- Implemented key **algebraic routines**, such as matrix diagonalization and solving linear differential equations.  
**Note:** Requires external data sources (some examples included).

### [Atmospheric Muon Monte Carlo Simulation (2020)](https://github.com/Osama-Yaghi/atmospheric-muon-simulation-KM3net)  
A Monte Carlo simulation estimating the atmospheric muon flux at KM3NeT detector sites, developed as part of an internship at the **LPC Caen** in collaboration with **BenoÃ®t Guillon**.  
**My contributions:**  
- Wrote the entire **Python-based simulation code** from scratch, modeling the relevant physics processes for muon propagation and detection.  
- Simulated the atmospheric muon flux, which is critical in evaluating the **background noise** in the experiment's signal.  
- Optimized code for improved computational efficiency and scalability.
